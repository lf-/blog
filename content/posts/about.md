Hi!

I'm a systems programmer working on build systems and developer tools, currently working on tooling for one of the largest Haskell codebases in the world.
I am one of the developers of [Lix], a Nix implementation focused on stability, production usage, gradual evolution, and user experience.

I care a lot about:
- Correctness
- Observability
- Operability
- Performance

In my spare time, when I am not dreaming of all computers landing on the sun, I work on a whole slew of projects you can find on my GitHub profile.

I'm most interested in compilers, operating systems, and build systems.
I am a full stack developer: I can competently write both SystemVerilog and websites, and most things in between: programming languages are a dime a dozen and I speak a lot of them, from Rust to Haskell, C/C++, Python, to Fake Haskell That Compiles to Bash (Nix language).
Kernels are fun and not scary!
I often cosplay (perhaps too successfully) as a build engineer.

When I *am* dreaming of computers experiencing solar destruction, I like sewing, going on long walks, and cooking.

To contact me, email `jade` at this domain (jade dot fyi) or ping me [on fedi](https://hachyderm.io/@leftpaddotpy).
