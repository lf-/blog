Hi!

I'm an final-year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the
University of British Columbia.

In my spare time, when I am not dreaming of all computers landing on the sun, I
work on [NixOS](https://nixos.org) in various places in the project, and a
whole slew of projects you can find on my GitHub profile. I'm most interested
in compilers, operating systems, and build systems. I am a full stack
developer: I can competently write both SystemVerilog and websites, and most
things in between: programming languages are a dime a dozen and I speak a lot
of them, from Rust to Haskell, C/C++, Python, to Fake Haskell That Compiles to
Bash (Nix). I often cosplay (perhaps too successfully) as a build engineer.

When I *am* dreaming of computers experiencing solar destruction, I like
sewing, going on long walks, and cooking.

To contact me, email `jade` at this domain (jade dot fyi) or ping me [on
fedi](https://hachyderm.io/@leftpaddotpy).
