Hello!

The full content on this site is available by RSS at
<https://jade.fyi/rss.xml>. I can make no promises as to how fabulously RSS
readers will render the full post contents without some kind of styling, but
they are included.

If you have any further requests on how I can make this site work better for
you, please email me at the address on the [About](/about) page or file an
issue on the [source repo](https://github.com/lf-/blog).

Enjoy your syndication adventures~
