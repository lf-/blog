Hi!

Well, it's about a year late to be posting this, but I'm transgender (and
many other labels, which I have elided). In late 2019, I had a hell of a long
weekend where I reconsidered a bunch of dusty memories I had forgotten about
or repressed. [I also rewrote the website while contemplating this](/blog/rewriting-the-blog-in-gatsby/).
At the time, though, I was not very confident in how I wanted to present
myself in general. This has changed, which is why I am writing this post.

My pronouns are she/her or they/them, and I don't mind if it's lowercase (it's
pretty!).

If you're having similar experiences, I know how isolating and scary it can
be initially. Feel free to [contact me](/about) if you want someone to talk
to. I'll do my best to help or just to be a friend.

I've also rewritten the website, for its third iteration, and moved domains
to `jade.fyi` to better align it with who I am. This time the blog is in
Zola, a static site generator written in Rust. If you want source code for
this site, [it's here](https://github.com/lf-/blog).

I consider accessibility to be a core feature. If you have any trouble using
the site, please email me or file an issue.

N.B.: rewriting the website is not "cute", jades only rewrite their website
while in extreme distress.
