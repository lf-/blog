Inflammatory title out of the way, let's go.

I think that Nix flakes have some considerable benefits, such as:

* Convenient pinning of evaluation-time dependencies
* Eliminating pointless rebuilds of code by only including tracked files in
  builds
* Making Nix code, on average, much more reproducible by pervasive pinning
* Allegedly caching evaluation
* Possibly making Nix easier to learn by reducing the amount of poking at
  strange attribute sets and general `NIX_PATH` brokenness

However, at the same time, there are a few things that one might be led to
think about flakes that are not the most effective way of doing things. I
personally use flakes relatively extensively in my own work, but there are
several ways I use them that are not standard, with reason.

Flakes are *optional*, and as much as some people whose salary depends on it
might say otherwise, they are not the (only) future of Nix: they are simply a
special entry point for Nix code with a built in pinning system, nothing more,
nothing less.

Nix continues to gather a reputation for bad documentation, in part because the
official documentation for nixpkgs and NixOS is *de facto* not allowed to talk
about flakes, as a policy. This situation is certainly partially due to a
divide between Nix developers and nixpkgs developers, which are groups with
surprisingly little overlap.

Flakes also are a symptom or cause of much intra-community strife between
"pro-flakes" and "anti-flakes" factions, but this situation is at some level a
sign of broken consensus processes and various actors trying to sidestep them,
an assumption by many people that the docs are "outdated" for not using flakes,
and the bizarre proliferation of flakes everywhere in blog posts or tutorials
leading to a belief that they are required for everything.

This post is about how to architect Nix projects in general, with a special eye
on how to do so with flakes while avoiding their limitations. It tries to
dispel misconceptions that can develop in such a monoculture.

# "Flakes are the composition primitive in Nix"

The Nix language, functions, and nixpkgs utilities are an effective composition
primitive, and are much better suited for putting parts of a project together,
especially if it is in a monorepo.

The most flexible way of building large systems with Nix is to merely use
flakes as an entry point, and develop the rest using "old" tools. This is for
multitudinous reasons:

- Flakes couple version control integration, dependency management and lockfile
  management. In medium sized projects, even at the scale of my dotfiles,
  locking dependencies of subprojects is often highly undesirable.

  They're not ideal for either working in the large or in the small: in the
  small, there is too much overhead in writing a separate `flake.nix` for some
  tiny utility, and in the large, for example, in nixpkgs, if flakes were
  actually used for dependency management, `flake.nix` would be 100,000 lines
  of `inputs` long.
- In terms of making flexible builds, flakes don't support configuration
  [except through hilarious abuses of
  `--override-input`][boolean-option]. This means that all build configuration
  variants have to be anticipated ahead of time, or that traditional
  nixpkgs/Nix language primitives need to be used instead.
- Flakes as a composition primitive is completely incompatible with cross
  compilation. Due to the lack of configuration support, `packages.${system}`
  cannot be used for cross compilation: there is nowhere to specify the
  architecture to build with.

[boolean-option]: https://github.com/boolean-option

Because of all of this, even in a flakes world, to compose software in the
large *and* in the small reusably and efficiently, the other composition
primitives provided by Nix and nixpkgs remain the best choices to assemble
software. A flake can then be relegated to merely an entry point and a way of
acquiring dependencies that are required for evaluation (build-time
dependencies should use `pkgs.fetchurl`, `fetchFromGitHub`, etc).

For example, to expose multiple configurations of a program, one might write it
the traditional way, using a lambda accepting some configuration parameters,
then call that lambda multiple times to expose multiple output attributes
inside the flake itself. This separates the capability to configure the
software from the actual defined configurations of the software, and avoids
letting the configuration non-system of flakes define how the internals of the
build definition work.

One of the largest simultaneous advantages and disadvantages of the Nix
language is that it is a Turing complete language, which causes pain to static
analysis, but is also one of its largest assets: you can program it. This can
be seen as a problem, but it also is awesome: you can programmatically patch
packages, define configuration dynamically, read files of arbitrary formats and
more.

Nix is a functional programming language, which means that its fundamental
composition primitive is the function. Even "fancy" objects like NixOS modules
or overlays are just functions that can be moved into separate files, imported,
or created through partial application of other functions (although, since
`imports` in modules are deduplicated by file name, NixOS modules generally
should be imported by path instead of generated by functions).

See the next section for concrete ways of composing software together.

# "Flakes are where you put your Nix code"

Flakes are merely a fancy schema for making a standardized entry point into Nix
code. Most of the Nix code in a project of any significant size should not be
in `flake.nix`, for several reasons.

The most trivial reason to put as little code as possible in `flake.nix` is
maintainability: there is as much rightward drift in `flake.nix` as in recent
German and Dutch elections (concerningly much!), so from just that perspective,
it's useful to move things out of it.

Let's talk about some standard patterns that have existed before flakes did,
which still are relevant in a flakes world.

## [`package.nix`][package-nix]

[package-nix]: https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/blob/41acc25766fbc611cd10cb043bc7cab91d2fd088/pkgs/by-name/README.md

I am using `package.nix` to refer to the standard way for writing packages in
nixpkgs style, which are invoked with `callPackage`. This is as opposed to
writing something directly in `flake.nix` using `pkgs`.

A `package.nix` file looks something like so:

```nix
{ # receives(*) pkgs.hello and pkgs.stdenv
  hello, stdenv,
  # can be overridden with `yourPackage.override { enableSomething = true; }`
  enableSomething ? false
}:
finalAttrs: # optional finalAttrs to refer to the set below; preferred over using `rec` attr sets
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  # ...
}
```

Package definitions should be written with `callPackage` if possible, rather
than inline in `flake.nix`, since using `package.nix` makes them into small,
composable, configurable, and portable units of software. Also, by using
`callPackage` and writing in nixpkgs style, it becomes a lot easier to move
packages between projects, and indeed to upstream them to nixpkgs, since they
look and work a familiar way.

### Cross compilation

A lesser-known fact is that `callPackage` is load-bearing for cross
compilation. If you write `pkgs.foo` in `nativeBuildInputs`, such a Nix
expression will break under cross compilation, but `foo` as an argument from
`callPackage` will not. This is because `callPackage` will magically resolve
`foo` appearing inside `nativeBuildInputs` to mean `pkgs.buildPackages.foo`;
that is, a package built for the build computer.

`callPackage` evaluates a Nix file multiple times with different
arguments and splices the results together such that `buildInputs` magically
receives target packages, and `nativeBuildInputs` receives build packages,
even if the same package name appears in both. Magic âœ¨

That is, in the following intentionally-flawed-for-other-reasons `flake.nix`:

```nix
{...}: {
  outputs = { nixpkgs, ... }:
  let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
  in {
    packages.x86_64-linux.x = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix { };
  };
}
```

then `package.nix`:

```nix
{ stdenv, hello, openssl }:
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  # ...
  # things used in the build go in here
  nativeBuildInputs = [ hello ];
  # libraries used by the resulting program go in here
  buildInputs = [ openssl ];
}
```

Incidentally, notice anything there? Yeah, it's flakes completely not
supporting cross compilation. See the next point. :D

It's possible to use the `pkgs.buildPackages` attribute to pull things into
`nativeBuildInputs`, and `pkgs` for `buildInputs` but it is not conventional
to do so, and is quite verbose.

[See the manual about these callPackage shenanigans][callPackage-intricacy]
for more details. See also: [the manual about dependency categories][cats].

## [Overlays]

[Overlays]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-overlays-definition

[An overlay][Overlays] is a function overriding nixpkgs which is evaluated
until it reaches a [fixed point]. An overlay takes two arguments, `final` and
`prev` (sometimes also called `self` and `super`), and returns an attribute set
that is shallowly replaced on top of nixpkgs with `//`.

Overlays are useful as a means for distributing sets of software outside of
nixpkgs, and still are useful in that role in a flakes world, since overlays
are simple functions that can be evaluated against any version of nixpkgs, and
if written with `callPackage`, cross compilation works. One may notice that the
`overlays` flake output is not architecture specific, which follows from their
definition as functions that take package sets and return modifications to
make; this is why they work properly here.

Evaluation to a fixed point means that it is evaluated as many times as necessary
until it stops referring to the `final` argument (or overflows the stack). This
idea appears in many places, including tables of contents in LaTeX, [Typst] or
other typesetting programs: by generating the table of contents, you may affect
the layout of subsequent pages and change their page numbers, but after the
first run of that, the layout will probably not change, since the only change
is the numbers, so *that* iteration likely converges to the final result.

`final` gives the *final* version of the attribute set, after overlays have
been evaluated as far as they will go; your overlay may be run multiple times
in evaluating an attribute in `final`, or even cause infinite recursion. `prev`
gives the version of nixpkgs prior to the present overlay or any further
overlays.

For example, we could write an overlay to override GNU Hello to be a wrapper
that makes a [reference to an excellent retrocomputing series][hellorld].
Content of `overlay.nix`:

[hellorld]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6mwbTGXGQ

```nix
final: prev: {
  hello = final.writeShellScriptBin "hello" ''
    ${prev.hello}/bin/hello -g "hellorld" "$@"
  '';
}
```

Then:

```
Â» nix run --impure --expr '(import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ (import ./overlay.nix) ]; }).hello'
hellorld
```

Here, the attribute `hello` of our modified `nixpkgs` now is our script that
calls the original `hello` to say "hellorld".

It's pretty easy to accidentally cause infinite recursion with overlays if
their laziness isn't correct. For example, attribute sets' attribute names are
evaluated strictly, with all names in an attribute set evaluated immediately,
but the values of attributes are lazily evaluated. [There have been attempts to
change this][lazy-attrs] but they were canned for performance reasons. Strict
attribute names can be a foot-gun, causing confusing infinite recursion in some
cases using `mapAttrs` or similar mechanisms on `prev` to generate the set of
things to override.

Infinite recursion is not typically a problem if an overlay doesn't actually
replace anything or contain self-references, as may be the case for overlays
distributing very simple software, and we can take advantage of that as shown
in the next section.

### The place of overlays in a flakes world

*Flakes don't support cross compilation.*

I am being a little bit tricky with the wording here. Flakes don't *stop* you
from doing cross compilation, but you have to do an end-run around flakes and
do it the "old" way.

Because of this design fault in flakes, namely, the lack of support for
parameters, the most compatible way of writing packaging in a flake project
is to write the package definitions into an overlay first, then expose the
packages from the overlay. Consumers that need cross compilation can use the
overlay with their own copy of nixpkgs, and consumers that don't care can use
it through `packages`.

Keeping in mind ["1000 instances of nixpkgs"][1000-nixpkgs], a reasonable way
of writing a flake that *doesn't modify anything in nixpkgs* and just adds
stuff is:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  inputs.flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    let
      out = system:
        let
          pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
          appliedOverlay = self.overlays.default pkgs pkgs;
        in
        {
          packages.myPackage = appliedOverlay.myPackage;
        };
    in
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem out // {
      overlays.default = final: prev: {
        myPackage = final.callPackage ./package.nix { };
      };
    };
}
```

Downstream consumers that need to cross compile in spite of flakes can use
the overlay, and other consumers can use `packages` as normal.

This uses a cute trick of calling the overlay, which is just a function, with
both `final` and `prev` as the final nixpkgs attribute set. This definitely
does not work on all overlays, since overlays can make self-references using
`final`, and indeed often need to do so, if they contain multiple derivations
that depend on each other.

However, with a little bit more work, this can be overcome very cleanly, while
also avoiding any possibility of name shadowing problems!

<aside>

If you're thinking "just use a `rec` attribute set", that's unfortunately
clever but flawed: `rec` will receive the version as of the execution of your
file, but not any overridden version, which is not the case for `makeScope` and
similar tools from nixpkgs.

In order to regain the ability to make self-references without being a real
overlay that uses `prev`, consider using [makeScope] ([example from
nixpkgs][makeScope-ex]) to create a smaller *scope*, within which self
references to other things in the same scope are allowed.

For example, here we create a scope with a dependency between derivations.
Content of `test.nix`, which could equivalently be an overlay:

```nix
let pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
in pkgs.callPackage ./scope.nix { makeScope = pkgs.lib.makeScope; }
```

and `scope.nix`:

```nix
{ makeScope, newScope, writeShellScriptBin }: makeScope newScope (self: {
  meow = writeShellScriptBin "meow" ''
    echo meow
  '';
  meow2 = writeShellScriptBin "meow2" ''
    echo "meow is at ${self.meow}"
  '';
})
```

Which gives the following result:

```
 Â» nix run --impure --expr '(import ./test.nix).meow'
meow
 Â» nix run --impure --expr '(import ./test.nix).meow2'
meow is at /nix/store/aj0fhn8is6w8q85h0ramnqz2di92plwc-meow
 Â» nix eval --impure --expr 'builtins.attrNames (import ./test.nix)'
[ "callPackage" "meow" "meow2" "newScope" "override" "overrideDerivation" "overrideScope" "overrideScope'" "packages" ]
```

[makeScope]: https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/blob/6a8b6b8f720b8d6f43ea870164eb489de5316077/lib/customisation.nix#L290-L303

</aside>

If you do have to use a real overlay that needs to replace things, import
nixpkgs again from your flake with the overlay as an argument. It's fine. It's
just a second of gratuitous evaluation time:

```nix
let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; overlays = [ self.overlays.default ]; };
in # ....
```

### NixOS modules

NixOS modules are, like overlays and `package.nix`, fundamentally just
functions which are invoked in a fancy way, and are not a flakes construct.

As used in flakes with the `nixosModules.*` output, they are
*architecture independent* since they are just functions, and if defining a
module for software that is built by the same flake, one would generally want to
use an overlay in [`nixpkgs.overlays`][nixpkgs.overlays] or the trick above,
invoking the overlay with `pkgs` twice, to actually bring it in (again, to
remain cross compilation compatible).

To keep with the theme of putting things outside of `flake.nix` to enable
reusability, the code for the module can be placed in a separate file that is
imported. Then, `flake.nix` is used to import that module and inject
dependencies from its environment.

[nixpkgs.overlays]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options#opt-nixpkgs.overlays

#### Injecting dependencies

There are a couple of ways to inject dependencies into NixOS modules from a
flake, one of which is mildly uglier. Injecting values from `flake.nix` into
NixOS is required for a couple of reasons, most notably, to use flakes-managed
dependencies inside NixOS configurations. It is also necessary to [properly
configure `NIX_PATH` so `<nixpkgs>` resolves in a flake
configuration][nixpath], since you need the actual inputs from `flake.nix` to
get a proper reference to nixpkgs suitable to create a dependency on the actual
flake input.

[nixpath]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/254405

The simplest (and most reasonable, in my view) way to inject dependencies from
a flake is to write an inline module that has them in its lexical closure inside of
`flake.nix`. If you want to be fancy, you could even make an option to store
the injected dependencies:

```nix
let depInject = { pkgs, lib, ... }: {
  options.dep-inject = lib.mkOption {
    type = with lib.types; attrsOf unspecified;
    default = { };
  };
  config.dep-inject = {
    # inputs comes from the outer environment of flake.nix
    flake-inputs = inputs;
  };
};
in {
  nixosModules.default = { pkgs, lib, ... }: {
    imports = [ depInject ];
  };
}
```

The uglier and perhaps more well-known way to inject dependencies into NixOS
modules from flakes is [`specialArgs`][specialArgs]. This is uglier, since it gets dumped into
the arguments for every module, which is unlike how every other bit of data
flow works in NixOS, and it also doesn't work outside of the flake that's
actually invoking `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem`. The latter is the much more
sinister part, and the reason I would strongly recommend inline modules with
closures instead of `specialArgs`: they break flake composition.

To use `specialArgs`, an attribute set is passed into `nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem`,
which then land in the arguments of NixOS modules:

```nix
# ...
nixosConfigurations.something = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  specialArgs = {
    myPkgs = nixpkgs;
  };
  modules = {
    { pkgs, lib, myPkgs }: {
      # do something with myPkgs
    }
  };
}
```

[specialArgs]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/options#opt-_module.args

#### Example

This could be equivalently done with the overlay invocation trick above on
pkgs.

For example, this defines a very practical NixOS module that meows at the user
on the console on boot:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }: {
    overlays.default = final: prev: {
      meow = final.writeShellScriptBin "meow" ''
        echo meow
      '';
    };

    nixosModules.default = { pkgs, config, lib, ... }: {
      imports = [ ./nixos-module.nix ];
      # inject dependencies from flake.nix, and don't do anything else
      config = lib.mkIf config.services.meow.enable {
        nixpkgs.overlays = [ self.overlays.default ];
        services.meow.package = lib.mkDefault pkgs.meow;
      };
    };

  };
}
```

and `nixos-module.nix` containing the actual code:

```nix
{ pkgs, config, lib, ... }:
let cfg = config.services.meow; in {
  options = {
    services.meow = {
      enable = lib.mkEnableOption "meow";
      package = lib.mkOption {
        description = "meow package to use";
        type = lib.types.package;
      };
    };
  };
  config = lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
    systemd.services.meow = {
      description = "meow at the user on the console";
      serviceConfig = {
        Type = "oneshot";
        ExecStart = "${cfg.package}/bin/meow";
        StandardOutput = "journal+console";
      };
      wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
    };
  };
}
```

{% codesample(desc="How I tested the above") %}

I put this into `flake.nix` above:

```nix
nixosConfigurations.test = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  modules = [
    self.nixosModules.default
    ({ pkgs, lib, ... }: {
      fileSystems."/" = {
        device = "/dev/sda1";
      };
      boot.loader.grub.enable = false;
      boot.initrd.enable = false;
      boot.kernel.enable = false;
      documentation.enable = false;
      environment.noXlibs = true;

      services.meow.enable = true;

      system.stateVersion = "23.05";
    })
  ];
};
```

Then I built the system configuration:

```
Â» nix build .#nixosConfigurations.test.config.system.build.toplevel
```

{% end %}

# "Flakes are the future of Nix, and the only CLI"

Many words have been spilled on the new CLI and its design, mostly focusing on
flakes. However, this is not the only mode of the new CLI: wherever it makes
sense, it actually fully supports non-flake usage.

To get more exact equivalence with the old CLI, `-L` (`--print-build-logs`) and
`--print-out-path` are useful. Equally, the *old* CLI can have its output
improved to that of the new CLI by passing `--log-format bar-with-logs`. I
would be remiss not to mention [nix-output-monitor] as a much nicer way of
watching Nix builds, as well.

# "Flakes are how to manage external dependencies"

Flakes are one way of managing external dependencies but they have many flaws
in that role.

One flaw is that all the dependencies need to be listed in one file, and there
is no way of scoping them into groups.

A poorly documented limitation of both flake inputs and the built in fetchers
in general, which is the reason they are banned in nixpkgs (in addition to
[`restrict-eval`][restrict-eval] making them not work), is that they block
further evaluation while fetching. The alternative to this is to use a
fixed-output derivation that performs the fetching at build time, such as is
done with `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`, `pkgs.fetchurl` and so on.

The blocking is not necessarily the biggest problem if the dependencies are Nix
code required to evaluate the build, but it can be troublesome when the
dependencies are not required to evaluate, since it [slows down and serializes
evaluation][ifd], downloading just one thing at a time. If the dependencies are
required for evaluation, there is little way to make this better, but for
instance, for builds requiring many inputs such as a pile of tree-sitter
grammars, Haskell package sources, or such, it adds up badly.

[ifd]: https://jade.fyi/blog/nix-evaluation-blocking/

## If not flakes then what?

There's a perfectly reasonable argument to be made for just treating
dependencies the same way as nixpkgs and directly calling `pkgs.fetchurl` and
such inside Nix source. This works fine, is conventional, and avoids the
evaluation-time-build-dependency ("import from derivation" (IFD)) problems.

It's nice to have tools to automatically update these and grab the appropriate
hash, though.

There are several tools that can maintain a lock file with Nix hashes, such as
[Niv], [npins], and [gridlock]. The first two sadly ship Nix files that use
built-in fetchers and thus have the evaluation performance issues, and the
latter doesn't ship any Nix code.

Thus, the solution is to ignore any provided Nix code for whichever one you choose
to use and write some code to read the tool's JSON file and pull the package
URL and hashes out, and call `pkgs.fetchurl` with them. This is quite easy to
do and we would recommend it.

# Why are there five ways of getting software?

It's possible to get lost in the sheer number of ways of doing things and lose
what any of it is for. I think this is actually worsened by flakes, *because*
they make examples self-contained, making them more easy to just pick up and
run without contemplation. Often a lot of blogs provide examples in flake form,
potentially as NixOS modules or other forms which have a lot of fanciness that
might be surplus to requirements for the desired application.

If one is new to Nix it gets very easy to think "Nix Nix Nix I shall reduce the
world to nothingness, Nix" and convert everything to be tangled with Nix, and
it helps to understand the available mechanisms and why one might need one
particular one.

The various ways of installing things have different relationships to
mutability and "effects". By effects, I mean, mutations to the computing
system, which other systems might use post-install scripts for. Nix derivations
don't support post-install scripts because "installing" doesn't mean anything.
By persistent, I mean that they have some lasting effect on the system besides
putting stuff in the Nix store.

This section perhaps deserves its own post, but I will briefly summarize:

## `flake.nix` (`default.nix`, `shell.nix`) in project directories

These are *developer* packaging of projects: pinned tool versions, not caring
as much about unifying dependencies with the system, etc. To this end, they
provide dev shells to work on a project, and are versioned *with* the project.
Additionally they may provide packaging to install a tool separately from
nixpkgs.

There are a couple of things that make these notable compared to the packaging
one might see in nixpkgs:
* In nixpkgs, more build time is likely tolerated, and there is little desire
  to do incremental compilation. Import from derivation is also banned from
  nixpkgs. For these reasons, packaging outside of nixpkgs likely uses
  different frameworks such as [`crane`][crane],
  [`callCabal2nix`][callCabal2nix] and other similar tools that reduce the
  burden of maintaining Nix packaging or speed up rebuilds.
* It's versioned with the software and so more crimes are generally tolerated:
  one might pin libraries or other such things, and update nixpkgs infrequently.
* They include the tools to *work on* a project, which may be a superset of the
  tools required to build it, for example in the case of checked-in generated
  code or other such things.
* They may include things like checks, post-commit hooks and other project
  infrastructure.

Shells are just made of environment variables and (without building one at
least) don't create a single `bin` folder of all the things in the shell, for
instance. Also, since they are made of environment variables, they don't have
much ability to perform effects such as managing services or on-disk state.

Use this for tools specific to one project, such as compilers and libraries for
that project. Depending on taste and circumstances, these may or may not be
used for language servers. Generally these are not used for providing tools
like `git` or `nix` that are expected to be on the system, unless they are
required to actually compile the software.

## Ephemeral shells (`nix shell`, `nix-shell -p`)

The ephemeral shell is one of the superpowers of Nix since it can appear
software from the ether without worrying about getting rid of it later. This
essentially has exactly the same power as project-specific `flake.nix` files:
you can bring packages into scope or do anything else that can be done there.

I would consider a project shell file to be simply a case of saving a
`nix-shell -p` invocation, and the motivation to do so is about the same, just
with more Software Engineering Maintainability Juice with pinning and such.

Use this for grabbing tools temporarily for whatever purpose that might have.

Note that for Bad Reasons, `nix-shell -p` is not equivalent to `nix
shell`: the latter does not provide a compiler or `stdenv` as would be
necessary to build software. The technical reason here is that `nix shell`
constructs the shell within C++ code in Nix, whereas `nix-shell -p` is more or
less `nix develop` on a questionable string templated expression involving
`pkgs.mkShell`.

## `nix profile`, `nix-env`

`nix profile` and `nix-env` build a directory with `bin`, `share`, and
such, symlinking to the actual packages providing the files. Under the hood,
these are mostly `pkgs.buildEnv`, which is a script that builds such a
structure out of symlinks. They then symlink it somewhere in PATH.

Personally, I don't think that `nix profile` and `nix-env` should ever be used
except when convinced to operate in a declarative manner, because they are the
exception in the Nix ecosystem as far as being both imperative and persistent,
and doing it declaratively avoids various brokenness by fully specifying
intent (they have some ugly edge cases in upgrades which are solved by simply
writing the Nix code specifying where the packages come from into a file).

Use these for nothing. Or not, I'm not a cop.

## [flakey-profile], `nix-env --install --remove-all --file`

The old Nix profile CLI actually supports declarative package installation,
although I wouldn't suggest it because [flakey-profile] is just plainly more
pleasant UX wise and is absolutely trivial in implementation. These do the same
thing as `nix profile` and `nix-env` in terms of building a directory with
`bin`, `share`, and such, and putting it somewhere in PATH.

Use these for lightweight declarative package management, perhaps on non-NixOS
systems (there's nothing stopping you using it on NixOS but NixOS itself is
right there).

## `home-manager`

Those who use `home-manager` generally use it to replace dotfile managers, as
well as configuring services and installing user-specific packages. I don't use
it because an approach based on symlinks into a git repo avoids adding an
unnecessary Nix build and much complexity to the config file iteration cycle.

`home-manager` has essentially the power of NixOS in terms of being able to
have effects such as services, activation scripts, etc, while being scoped to
one user.

Use this for installing packages on one user, potentially not on a NixOS
system, in a declarative manner, as well as configuring user-scoped services.
Note that this overlaps with profiles as described above; it's just a heavier
weight mechanism built with the same tools.

## NixOS/`nix-darwin`

NixOS and `nix-darwin` are system-wide configuration management systems built
on top of Nix profiles, combined with activation scripts. They allow installing
and configuring services, and managing config files in a declarative manner.
In terms of both implementation and usage, these do similar things to
`home-manager`, but scoped system-wide.

Use this for installing packages system-wide and configuring services.

# Conclusion

I hope to have successfully covered why flakes aren't everything, and perhaps
even why they aren't real. Although nixpkgs isn't always a shining example of
fabulous Nix project architecture, it is a large project, and there is a
lot to be learned from how they organize things, which arguably was more than
was internalized while flakes were designed.

Even assuming that flakes are good at macro-level composition, they often are
accompanied by poor use of micro-level composition, which still is best done
by using the old primitives.

With better architecture, we can work around the limitations of flakes to
create pleasant-to-work-with and extensible Nix code. We can clarify the
meaning of all the "just write a flake" blog posts to see the Nix tools within
and avoid spurious, unnecessary, dependencies on flakes that make code harder
to understand.
