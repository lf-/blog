Hi!

I'm a student who does a lot of interdisciplinary tech stuff. Presently I'm studying at UBC Vancouver as a first year with a focus on robotics stuff.

I do mechanical design for ThunderBots, a RoboCup Small Size League team building soccer-playing robots. Prior to this, I was on a 4 person team participating in Skills Canada Robotics, and in my last year of high school, we had the opportunity to [go to Nationals in Halifax](blog/i-competed-in-skills-canada-robotics), where we achieved first place for Saskatchewan.

Other than robotics, I have experience in [electronics](blog/i-designed-and-built-a-mechanical-macropad-numpad/), programming in most mainstream languages, and Linux.

To contact me, email `jade` at this domain (`LFCODE` dot ca).
