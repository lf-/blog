Hi!

I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the University of
British Columbia.

I have done mechanical design for ThunderBots, a RoboCup Small Size League team
building soccer-playing robots. Prior to this, I was on a 4 person team
participating in Skills Canada Robotics, and in my last year of high school, we
had the opportunity to [go to Nationals in
Halifax](blog/i-competed-in-skills-canada-robotics), where we achieved first
place for Saskatchewan.

Other than robotics, I am most interested in Rust and embedded systems,
especially the security thereof.

To contact me, email `jade` at this domain (`LFCODE` dot ca).
